# Dino Arrays - Dynamic Arrays
Single header file that implements dynamic arrays and define

``` c
#define DINO_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "dinoarray.h"
```

Why are they called Dino Arrays and not dynamic arrays? Not even I know.

You can also define custom malloc and free functions. Define these above the include statement.

``` c
#define DINO_MALLOC customMalloc
#define DINO_FREE customFree
```
